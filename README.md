# python_coding_sessions

## Objective

The point of establishing this repository is to gain additional understanding for data algorithms and structures and to write clean python code. Grasping concepts in Big O Notation. Analyzing Big O Notation is essential in technical interview settings and especially so in top-tier tech companies due to larger data sets and focusing more on application performance. A non-efficient solution may cost just a few milliseconds in a coding exercise, but can cost massive performance loss across millions of users and gigantic datasets.  A lot of candidates may get tripped up on the analysis, but in this course you'll learn exactly how to deliver that analysis with confidence.

### Writing in Python

Why Python?  It's a fairly simple language to read (and very similar to Javascript, Java, or C).  So, even if one doesn't know it well, they will still be able to understand it and adapt it to any other language like Javascript, C, PHP, Java, etc., Python is also widely used at Google/YouTube, Facebook/Instagram, Netflix, Uber, Dropbox, and many more.  It is a modern language and its conciseness makes it an ideal choice for interviews.
